<h4>Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh</h4>
<p> My name is Mst. Rasheda Akther Urmi.
I am Bangladeshi and my native language is Bangla but I can also speak English.
I grew up in Chittagong which is the commercial capital of Bangladesh.
I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at International Islamic University Chittagong.
My major is Computer Science and Engineering. I am also working as a teacher assistant in my university.
There I taught programming courses to the students.
I like programming and problem solving so much. I try to participate in online programming contest in every week. I have also participated in some National level programming contest like NGPC 2018 and 2019.
Now I am working on my thesis and also aiming to publish a paper on Recognizing Art Style Automatically in Painting Using convolutional Neural network. Painting and travelling is my hobby.</p>
<p>Be your own boss the most common reason for starting out as a freelancer.
There’s no 9a.m to 5a.m unless I want there to be. If I feel most productive between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., then I can work in that time.I can choose the Projects I Want to Work On.Every day in freelance life brings new challenges, and I think I’ll learn from each of them and enable to enhance my skills. For all of those reason I want to be a freelancer.For that now I started class in "Full Stack Web Development" course in Shikhbe Sobai.My mentor name is Mr. Frid Rony. </p>
